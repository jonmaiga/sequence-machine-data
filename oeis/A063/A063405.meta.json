  "description": "T(n,m) for positive n,m is the first integer we get when iterating f starting with f(n/m), where function f on rationals is defined as f(p/q)=abs(p-q)/NextOddCollatz(p)(we assume p,q coprime), where NextOddCollatz(p) is the next odd number that is found in the Collatz trajectory of p. When no integer is reached by iteration, T(n,m)=0.",

  "description": "Let {c(i)} = A007916 denote the sequence of numbers > 1 which are not perfect powers. Every positive integer n has a unique representation as a tower n = c(x_1)^c(x_2)^c(x_3)^...^c(x_k), where the exponents are nested from the right. The sequence is an irregular triangle read by rows, where the n-th row lists x_1, ..., x_k.",

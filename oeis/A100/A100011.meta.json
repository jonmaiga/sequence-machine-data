  "description": "Iterated hyperdodecahedron numbers, starting with hyperdodecahedron(2) = 600. The hyperdodecahedron numbers are 4-dimensional figurate numbers based on the 120-cell regular polytope, also known as the hecatonicosachoron or hyperdodecahedron. This sequence is hyperdodecahedron(2), hyperdodecahedron(hyperdodecahedron(2)) and so on recursively.",

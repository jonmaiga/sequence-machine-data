  "description": "Iterated hypericosahedron numbers, starting with hypericosahedron(2) = 120. The hypericosahedron numbers are 4-dimensional figurate numbers based on the 600-cell regular convex polytope, also known as the hexacosichoron or hypericosahedron. This sequence is hypericosahedron(2), hypericosahedron(hypericosahedron(2)) and so on recursively.",

  "description": "Numbers of orders of nontrivial positive magic-squares with magic sum n. A nontrivial positive magic square is a k-by-k array of consecutive positive integers (not necessarily including 1) such that all rows, all columns and the two diagonals each add up to the same constant (the \"magic sum\"), with the additional restriction that k (the \"order\") is greater than 1.",

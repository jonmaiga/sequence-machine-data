  "description": "For S a string of numbers, let F(S) = the sum of those numbers. Let a(1)=1. For n>1, a(n) is the largest k such that the string a(1)a(2)...a(n-1) can be written in the form [x][y_1][y_2]...[y_k] where each y_i is of positive (but not necessarily equal) length and for any i=F(y_(i+1)).",

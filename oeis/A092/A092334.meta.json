  "description": "For S a finite string of numbers, let M(S) denote the maximal number among them. Let a(1)=1. For n>1, a(n) is the greatest k such that the string a(1)a(2)...a(n-1) can be written in the form [x][y_1][y_2]...[y_k] where each y_i is of positive (but not necessarily equal) length and M(y_i)=M(y_j) for all i,j.",

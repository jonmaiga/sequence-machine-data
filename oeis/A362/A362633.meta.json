  "description": "Square array read by antidiagonals: Consider n k-sided fair dice, whose faces are numbered 1, ..., n*k (in any order). The outcome of a roll of the dice determines an ordering of them. T(n,k) is the minimum difference of the number of outcomes resulting in the most common ordering and the number of outcomes resulting in the least common ordering, n,k >= 1.",

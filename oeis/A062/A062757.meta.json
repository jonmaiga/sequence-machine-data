  "description": "Denominator of sum of first n terms of the series 1/15 + 1/63 + 1/80 ... in which the denominators are perfect squares - 1 which are simultaneously other powers, e.g. a(1) = 15 because 16 = 4^2 = 2^4, a perfect square that is also a fourth power; hence 16-1 = 15 qualifies as a term.",

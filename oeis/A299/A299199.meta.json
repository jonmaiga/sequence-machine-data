  "description": "In factorial base, any rational number has a terminating expansion; hence we can devise a self-inverse permutation of the rational numbers, say f, such that for any rational number q, the representations of q and of f(q) in factorial base are mirrored around the radix point and q and f(q) have the same sign; a(n) = f(1/n).",

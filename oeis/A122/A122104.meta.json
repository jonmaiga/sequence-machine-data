  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of deco polyominoes of height n and such that the sum of the bottom levels of all columns is k (n>=1, k>=0; informally, the number of the \"missing\" cells in the right bottom corner of the polyomino). A deco polyomino is a directed column-convex polyomino in which the height, measured along the diagonal, is attained only in the last column.",

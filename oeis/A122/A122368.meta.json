  "description": "Dimension of 4-variable non-commutative harmonics (twisted derivative). The dimension of the space of non-commutative polynomials in 4 variables which are killed by all symmetric differential operators (where for a monomial w, d_{xi} ( xi w ) = w and d_{xi} ( xj w ) = 0 for i/=j).",

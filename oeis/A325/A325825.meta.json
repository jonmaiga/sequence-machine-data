  "description": "Square array giving the monic polynomial q satisfying q = gcd(P(x),P(y)) where P(x) and P(y) are polynomials in ring GF(3)[X] with coefficients in {0,1,2} given by the ternary expansions of x and y. The polynomial q is converted back to a ternary number, and then expressed in decimal.",

  "description": "If you sum 3 consecutive odd prime numbers p,q,r, you get a number s which is either prime or not: p+q+r=s. If s is prime, you call it p and repeat the game. If s is not prime, you call the largest prime factor p and repeat the game. Finally, you get into an infinite cycle, which is one of the above 3 sequences, no matter what initial prime numbers you choose.",

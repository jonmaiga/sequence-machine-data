  "description": "Let R = Z[(1+sqrt(5))/2] denote the ring of integers in the real quadratic number field of discriminant 5. Then a(n) is the largest integer k such that every totally positive element of norm n in R can be written as a sum of three squares in R in at least k ways, or 0 if there is no totally positive element of norm n.",

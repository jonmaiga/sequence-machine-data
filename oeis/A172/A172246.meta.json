  "description": "Consider all ways of writing n = a + b where a<=b, gcd(a,b,n)=1, and having the same value of the function N(a,b,n) defined as product of the distinct prime divisors of a*b*n. Let w be the list of frequencies of distinct terms N(a, b, n) found among these partitions. If no frequency is more than 1 then a(n) = 0, otherwise a(n) = [the sum of elements of w] - [the number of elements of w] + 1.",

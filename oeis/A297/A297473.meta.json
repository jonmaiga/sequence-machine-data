  "description": "For any number n > 0, let f(n) be the polynomial of a single indeterminate x where the coefficient of x^e is the prime(1+e)-adic valuation of n (where prime(k) denotes the k-th prime); f establishes a bijection between the positive numbers and the polynomials of a single indeterminate x with nonnegative integer coefficients; let g be the inverse of f; a(n) = g(f(n)^2).",

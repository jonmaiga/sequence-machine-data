  "description": "Given n, define the sequence x(1) = n, thereafter if x(i) is even set x(i+1) = x(i)/2, if x(i) is odd and divisible by 3, 5 or 7 set x(i+1) = 5*x(i) + 1, otherwise set x(i+1) = 3*x(i) + 1. Then a(n) is the smallest i>1 such that x(i) = 1, 5, or 553, or -1 if none of those numbers is ever reached.",

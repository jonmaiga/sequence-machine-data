  "description": "Define the Fibonacci polynomials by F[1] = 1, F[2] = x; for n > 2, F[n] = x*F[n-1] + F[n-2] (cf. A049310, A053119). Swamy's inequality states that F[n]^2 <= G[n] = (x^2 + 1)^2*(x^2 + 2)^(n-3) for all n >= 3 and all real x. The sequence gives a triangle of the coefficients of the even exponents of G[n] - F[n]^2 read by rows.",

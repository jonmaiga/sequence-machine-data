  "description": "A variation on Recam√°n's sequence (A005132): to get a(n), we first try to subtract n from a(n-1): a(n) = a(n-1)-n if positive and not already in the sequence; if not then we try to add n: a(n) = a(n-1)+n if not already in the sequence; if this fails we try to subtract 2n from a(n-1), or to add 2n to a(n-1), or to subtract 3n, or to add 3n, etc., until one of these produces a positive number not already in the sequence.",

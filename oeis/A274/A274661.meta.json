  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n, m) gives the m-th contribution T(n, m)*cos((2*m+1)*v) to the coefficient of q^n in the Fourier expansion of Jacobi's elliptic cn(u|k) function when expressed in the variables v = u/(2*K(k)/Pi) and q, the Jacobi nome, written as series in (k/4)^2. K is the real quarter period of elliptic functions.",

  "description": "a(n) is the number of steps needed to reach 1 (or -1 if 1 is never reached) using the following rule: Begin with k = n. On each step, if k is divisible by 9, then divide it by 9; otherwise, if k has not already appeared during the iterative process, concatenate k with the digit d which makes the resulting number divisible by 9, and divide by 9; otherwise, concatenate d with k, and divide by 9.",

  "description": "Let P be the sequence of distinct lattice points defined by the following rules: P(1) = (0,0), P(2) = (1,0), and for any n > 2, P(n) is the closest lattice point to P(n-1) such that the Z-coordinate of the cross product of the vectors (P(n-1), P(n)) and (P(n-1), P(j)) is strictly negative for j=1..n-2, and in case of a tie, P(n) maximizes the dot product of the vectors (P(n-2), P(n-1)) and (P(n-1), P(n)); a(n) = X-coordinate of P(n).",

  "description": "Let P be the sequence of distinct lattice points defined by the following rules: P(1) = (0,0), P(2) = (1,0), and for any n > 2, P(n) is the closest lattice point to P(n-1) such that P(n) is a vertex of the convex hull of the set of points {P(1), ..., P(n)}, and in case of a tie, P(n) maximizes the dot product of the vectors (P(n-2), P(n-1)) and (P(n-1), P(n)); a(n) = Y-coordinate of P(n).",

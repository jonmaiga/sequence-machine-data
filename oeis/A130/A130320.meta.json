  "description": "Given n numbers n>(n-1)>(n-2)>...>2>1, adding the first and last numbers leads to the identity n+1 = (n-1)+2 = (n-2)+3 = ... In case if some positive x_1, x_2, ... are added to n, (n-1) etc, the strict inequality could be retained. This could be repeated finitely many times till it ends in inequality of form M > N where M-N is minimal. This sequence gives the value of M for different n.",

  "description": "Let p and q be two prime numbers, not necessarily consecutive, such that q - p = 2n; a(n) is the number of distinct partitions of 2n into even numbers so that each partition corresponds to a consecutive prime difference pattern (k-tuple) and p<=A000230(n). Multiple occurrences of a partition are not counted.",

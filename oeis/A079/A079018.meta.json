  "description": "Suppose p and q = p+16 are primes. Define the difference pattern of (p,q) to be the successive differences of the primes in the range p to q. There are 17 possible difference patterns, namely [16], [4,12], [6,10], [10,6], [12,4], [4,2,10], [4,6,6], [4,8,4], [6,4,6], [6,6,4], [10,2,4], [4,2,4,6], [4,2,6,4], [4,6,2,4], [6,4,2,4], [4,2,4,2,4], [2,2,4,2,4,2]. Sequence gives smallest value of p for each difference pattern, sorted by magnitude.",

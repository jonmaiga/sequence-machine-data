  "description": "Let G(n) be the set of numbers between 2^(n-1) and 2^n-1, inclusive. There is a unique number m(n) in G(n) so that the denominator of the m(n)-th partial sum of the double harmonic series is divisible by smaller 2-power than that of others in G(n). This power is defined to be a(n).",

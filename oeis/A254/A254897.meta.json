  "description": "Define a family of sequences as follows: a(1) and a(2) are prime numbers, then if a(n-2) and a(n-1) have the same parity a(n)=(a(n-2)+a(n-1))/2 and if not a(n)=a(n-2)/2+a(n-1) for a(n-2) even or a(n)=a(n-2)+a(n-1)/2 for a(n-1) even. Start the first sequence with the two smallest prime numbers 2 and 3; in general, start the next sequence with the two smallest prime numbers not present in all preceding sequences; the present sequence lists the initial term of all these sequences.",

  "description": "Given a distribution of n balls, labeled 1,...,n, among n unlabeled contents-ordered urns, arrange the nonempty urns in increasing order of their initial elements: U_1,...U_k and sum the quantities (i-1)(card U_i - 1) for i=1,...,k to get the \"weight\" of this distribution. These numbers represent the number of distributions of even weight minus the number with odd weight.",

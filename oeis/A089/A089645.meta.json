  "description": "Penny Flipping, or Flipping Coins: Given a stack of n coins, flip the top coin, then the stack of the top two coins, then the stack of the top three etc... starting again with the top coin after flipping all n coins. A flip of m coins reverses their order and inverts their state. This is the number of flips required to restore the stack to its original configuration.",

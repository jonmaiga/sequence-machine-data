  "description": "a(1)=11; for n>1, a(n) is the smallest prime not occurring earlier beginning with a(n-1) without its first digit. Single-digit primes are not allowed unless they arise from the previous term as multi-digit number with leading zero(s) (i.e., a(n-1) has 0 as second digit) which are remembered for the subsequent left-truncations.",

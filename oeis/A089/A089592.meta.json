  "description": "For any prime p, define a sequence S_p: S_p(1) = p and S_p(n+1) is the least prime > S_p(n) that begins with the last digit of S_p(n). Let f(p) be the first member of S_p that is the digit reversal of the previous member. Sequence contains primes p that such that f(p) does not equal f(q) for any q < p.",

  "description": "Consider the generalized Mancala solitaire (A002491); to get n-th term, start with n and successively round up to next k multiples of n-1, n-2, ..., 1, for n>=1. Now construct the array, t, such that t(n,k) is the n-th and successively rounding up to the next k multiples. This sequence is the determinant of that array.",

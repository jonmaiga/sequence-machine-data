  "description": "For any composite number n with more than a single prime factor, take the polynomial defined by the product of the terms (x-pi)^ei, where pi are the prime factors of n with multiplicities ei. Integrate this polynomial from the minimum to the maximum value of pi. This sequence lists the numbers for which the integral is an integer.",

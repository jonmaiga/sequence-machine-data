  "description": "Solutions to phi(gpf(x)) - gpf(phi(x)) = 14 = c are special multiples of 17, x = 17k, where greatest prime factors of factor k were observed from {2, 3, 5}, i.e., it is smaller than 17. See solutions to other even cases of c (=A070813): A007283 for 0, A070004 for 2, A070815 for 254, A070816 for 65534. Gpf = greatest prime factor.",

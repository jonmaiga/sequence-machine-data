  "description": "Cardinalities of the sets of fusible numbers obtained at the consecutive steps of their construction as follows. We set S(0) = {0}. S(n+1) is obtained by adding to S(n) the sums (x+y+1)/2 for all x,y from S(n) with the property |x-y| < 1. Then, a(n) is the number of elements in S(n).",

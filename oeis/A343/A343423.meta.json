  "description": "Prime numbers p such that Euclidean distance from origin to p in hexagonal grid sets a new record. Number '1' is placed at the origin and '2' at (1, 0). Number 'm' (m >= 3) is placed by moving one unit forward in the direction from 'm-2' to 'm-1', if m - 1 is not a prime; otherwise, making 1/6 turn counterclockwise at 'm-1' followed by moving one unit forward.",

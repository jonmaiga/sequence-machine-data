  "description": "Let w = (w_1, w_2, ..., w_n) be a permutation of the integers {1, 2, ..., n}, and let f(k, w) be the length of the longest monotone subsequence of (w_k, w_{k+1}, ..., w_n) starting with w_k. Then a(n) is the number of permutations w in S_n such that Sum_{k=1..n} f(k,w) is minimized.",

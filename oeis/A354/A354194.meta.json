  "description": "Numbers k for which phi(A267099(k)) is equal to phi(k), but the number of 4m+1 and 4m+3 primes in the prime factorization of k (when counted with multiplicity) is not equal. Here A267099 is fully multiplicative involution swapping the positions of 4m+1 and 4m+3 primes, and phi is Euler totient function.",

  "description": "T(w,h) is the number of non-congruent quadrilaterals whose vertices with integer coordinates (x_i, y_i) all lie on the perimeter of a rectangle of width w and height h, with no 3 points on the same edge of the rectangle, max(x_i) - min(x_i) = w and max(y_i) - min(y_i) = h, such that the 6 distances between the 4 vertices are distinct.",

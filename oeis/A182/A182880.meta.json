  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of weighted lattice paths in L_n having k (1,1)-steps. L_n is the set of lattice paths of weight n that start at (0,0) and end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: a (1,0)-step with weight 1; a (1,0)-step with weight 2; a (1,1)-step with weight 2; a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.",

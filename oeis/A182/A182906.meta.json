  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of weighted lattice paths in F[n] having endpoint height k (k<=floor(n/2)). The members of F[n] are paths of weight n that start at (0,0), do not go below the horizontal axis, and whose steps are of the following four kinds: an (1,0)-step with weight 1, an (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.",

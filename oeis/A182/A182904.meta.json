  "description": "Number of weighted lattice paths in L_n having no peaks. The members of L_n are paths of weight n that start at (0,0), end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: an (1,0)-step with weight 1, an (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps. A peak is a (1,1)-step followed by a (1,-1)-step.",

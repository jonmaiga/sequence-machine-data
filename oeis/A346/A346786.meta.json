  "description": "If a(n) is prime, then a(n) + a(n+1) is prime; if a(n) is not prime, then a(n) + a(n+1) is not prime. This is also true for pairs of consecutive digits: if the first one is prime, the sum of the pair is also prime; if the first one is nonprime, the sum of the pair is nonprime. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms > 0 with this property.",

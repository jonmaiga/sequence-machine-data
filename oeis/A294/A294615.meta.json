  "description": "a(n) is the smallest prime p such that there is a multiplicative subgroup H of Z/pZ, of odd order and of index 2n, such that for any two cosets H1 and H2 of H, H1 + H2 contains all of (Z/pZ)\\0, except that H+H contains all of (Z/pZ)\\0 except -H. If no such prime exists, a(n) = 0.",

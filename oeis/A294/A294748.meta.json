  "description": "Define one of the generalized Syracuse sequences starting with a positive odd integer 2*k+1=x(1), then if x(i) is an odd prime set x(i+1)=2*x(i)+1, if x(i) is odd not prime set x(i+1)=3*x(i)+1, if x(i) is even then set x(i+1)=x(i)/2. This sequence gives the positive odd integers 2*k+1=x(1) for sequences reaching x(i)=1.",

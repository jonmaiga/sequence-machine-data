  "description": "Define a set of generalized Syracuse sequences starting with x(1)=2*n+1 a positive odd integer, if x(i) is odd prime set x(i+1)=67*x(i)+1, if x(i) is odd not prime set x(i+1)=3*x(i)+1 and if x(i) is even then set x(i+1)=x(i)/2. Then a(n) is the first index i > 1 at which x(i) reaches 1.",

  "description": "After a(1) = 1, the sequence is always extended with the smallest divisor d (not yet present in the sequence) of the last term t. If d doesn't exist, we extend the sequence with tt (t concatenated to itself). If tt doesn't produce a new d, we extend the sequence with ttt, etc. See the Comments section for more details.",

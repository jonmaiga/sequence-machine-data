  "description": "a(n) is the \"real\" part of f(n) = Sum_{k >= 0} g(d_k) * (4 + w)^k where g(0) = 0 and g(1 + u + 2*v) = (1 + u) * (1 + w)^v for any u = 0..1 and v = 0..5, Sum_{k >= 0} d_k * 13^k is the base-13 representation of n and w = -1/2 + sqrt(-3)/2 is a primitive cube root of unity; sequence A348921 gives \"w\" parts.",

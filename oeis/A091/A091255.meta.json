  "description": "Square array computed from gcd(P(x),P(y)) where P(x) and P(y) are polynomials with coefficients in {0,1} given by the binary expansions of x and y, and the polynomial calculation is done over GF(2), with the result converted back to a binary number, and then expressed in decimal. Array is symmetric, and is read by falling antidiagonals.",

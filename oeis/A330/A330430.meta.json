  "description": "Consider integers k=0,1,2,... as strings. Compare each digit in the string, in left-to-right order, with the contents of a bag (multiset) of digits, which is initially empty. If digit d is in the bag delete d from both the string and the bag. What remains of any nonempty string is appended to the sequence and its digits are added to the bag.",

  "description": "A variant of Landau's function (A000793) with a restriction on the length of cycles. a(n) is the largest value of lcm(p_1, ..., p_k), with p_1 + ... + p_k <= n, such that there exist integer offsets f_1, ..., f_k with 0 <= f_i < p_i, for which f_i and f_j are different modulo gcd(p_i, p_j).",

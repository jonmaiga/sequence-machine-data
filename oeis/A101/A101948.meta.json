  "description": "For any n >= 0 and b >= 2, let k be the length of the base-b expansion of n and let M(n, b) be the 2 X k matrix whose first row contains the first k primes in descending order and whose second row contains the base-b expansion of n. Let f(n, b) = determinant[transpose(M(n, b))*M(n, b)]. Sequence gives f(n, 5).",

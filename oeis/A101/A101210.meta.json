  "description": "Charlie Chaplin numbers: Stage 1: the input is the sequence F(n) = 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,... of alternating 1's and 2s, starting with F(1)=1. Let m = 1. At each iteration take F(m) and add it to F(m+F(m)) then increment m by 1 and repeat. The numbers are the values of F(m) which are larger than all previous values.",

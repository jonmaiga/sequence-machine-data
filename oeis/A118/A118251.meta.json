Concatenate onto the end of the sequence (from left to right) the integer m_n converted into binary and reversed (with the most significant digit on the right), where m_n is the smallest integer > A118252(n-1) and whose reversed binary representation does not occur anywhere earlier in the sequence (when the concatenated sequence is read from left to right). A118252(n) then equals m_n when written in decimal.",

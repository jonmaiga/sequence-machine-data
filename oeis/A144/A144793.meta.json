  "description": "Consider the runs of 0's in the binary representation of n, each of these runs being on the edge of the binary representation n and/or being bounded by 1's. Consider also the runs of 1's in the binary representation of n, each of these runs being on the edge of the binary representation n and/or being bounded by 0's. A positive integer n is included in this sequence if the length of the shortest such run of 0's in binary n equals the length of the shortest such run of 1's in binary n.",

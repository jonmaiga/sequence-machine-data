  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of subpermutations of an n-set, whose orbits are each of size at most k with at least one orbit of size exactly k, and without fixed points. Equivalently, T(n,k) is the number of partial derangements of an n-set each of whose orbits is of size at most k with at least one orbit of size exactly k, and without fixed points.",

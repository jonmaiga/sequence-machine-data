  "description": "The number of different lattice paths from (0,0) to (2n,0) using steps of S={(i,i) or (i,-i): i=1,2,...,n} with j flaws(j=1,2,...,n-1), where the j flaws is the sum of lengths of down steps below the x-axis. (For down steps that are partly above and partly below the x-axis we just count the part below the x-axis.) This number is independent of the number of flaws.",

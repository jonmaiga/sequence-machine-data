  "description": "For an oriented graph D, let X_m(D) be the number of copies of D in a random tournament (i.e., a complete graph, each of whose edges is directed randomly with probability 1/2 for each direction) on m vertices. a(n) is the denominator of the minimum limit, as m tends to infinity, of Var(X_m(D))/m^A373775(n) over all weakly connected oriented graphs D on n vertices.",

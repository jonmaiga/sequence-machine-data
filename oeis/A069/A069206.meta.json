  "description": "Let m(n,k) be the sequence defined by m(n,1)=1, m(n,2)=n, m(n,k+2)=(m(n,k+1)+m(n,k))/2 if m(n,k+1)+m(n,k) is even, m(n,k+2)=m(n,k+1)-m(n,k) otherwise. Sequence gives the (experimentally unique) solution to m(n,x)=0 (for k > this solution m(n,k) is constant = +1 or -1 depending on n) or a(n)=0 if there is no solution (in this case the cycle (1,3,2,-1,-3,-2) is reached).",

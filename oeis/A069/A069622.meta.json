  "description": "Let Power(n) be the sequence of integer roots or powers of n. Power(1) is 1,1,1,1,... Power(4) is 1,2,4,16,64,256,... Power(27) is 1,3,9,27,729,... Power (p^k) is 1,p,p^a,p^b,...p^k, p^2k,p^3k,...where p is a prime and a,b etc. are divisors of k. This is the sequence of the n-th term of Power(n).",

  "description": "Fill an infinite square array by following a spiral around the origin; if the square at position (x, y) is empty then set either T(x, y) = 1 or T(x, y) = T(2*x, 2*y) = 2 such that the RUNS transform of the sequence of values as they are chosen equals the sequence of values as they are visited; first choose the value 1. This sequence corresponds to the values as they are chosen.",

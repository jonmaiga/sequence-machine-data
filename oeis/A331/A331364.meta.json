  "description": "If the set of nonzero digits of n in some base of the form 2^2^k (with k >= 0) has exactly two elements, let b be the least such base and u and v the corresponding two nonzero digits; the base b representation of a(n) is obtained by replacing the u's by v's and vice versa in the base b representation of n; otherwise a(n) = n.",

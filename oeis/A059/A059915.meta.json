  "description": "A sequence f(n) of positive integers is called an F-sequence (in memory of Fibonacci) if it satisfies f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(2)=2 and for all n > 2, either f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) or f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3). A positive integer is called an F-number if it occurs in any F-sequence. Sequence gives numbers which are not F-numbers.",

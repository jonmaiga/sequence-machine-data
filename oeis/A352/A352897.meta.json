  "description": "Maximum value of bigomega (A001222) computed for all the terms x (including the starting term x=n), when map x -> A352892(x) is iterated down to the first x <= 2, or -1 if such number is never reached. Here A352892 is the next odd term in the Collatz or 3x+1 map (A139391) conjugated by unary-binary-encoding (A156552).",

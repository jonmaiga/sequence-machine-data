  "description": "The squarefree dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one block consisting of the indices (or positions) of the blocks containing that vertex, counted without multiplicity. Then a(n) is the number of non-isomorphic multiset partitions of weight n whose squarefree dual is strict (no repeated blocks).",

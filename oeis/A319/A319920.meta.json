  "description": "Let f(1) = 1 + i (where i denotes the imaginary unit) and for n > 0, f(n+1) is the Gaussian prime in the first quadrant (with positive real part and nonnegative imaginary part) with least modulus that divides 1 + Product_{k=1..n} f(k) (in case of a tie minimize the imaginary part); a(n) is the square of the modulus of f(n).",

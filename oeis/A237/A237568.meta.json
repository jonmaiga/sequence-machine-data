  "description": "Fibonacci-like sequence of numbers with nondecreasing positive digits. Let a^+ denote the number that is obtained from a if its positive digits are written in nondecreasing order, while zeros remain in their places. Let a<+>b = (a + b)^+. a(0)=0, a(1)=1, for n>=2, a(n) = a(n-1) <+> a(n-2).",

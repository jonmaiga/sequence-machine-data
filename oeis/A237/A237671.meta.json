  "description": "Let m_n denote the number which is obtained from n-base representation of m if its digits are written in nondecreasing order; then a(n) is the smallest period of the sequence which is defined by the recurrence b(0)=0, b(1)=1, b(k)=(b(k-1) + b(k-2))_n, for k>=2, or a(n)=0, if there is no such period.",

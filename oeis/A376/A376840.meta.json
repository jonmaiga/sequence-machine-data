  "description": "Take the integer partitions with at least 2 parts in order of their associated multinomial coefficients; a(n) is the sum of the n-th partition, i.e., the number of the row of A036038 (or A078760) in which the multinomial coefficient appears. In case of ties, take the sums (or row numbers) in nondecreasing order.",

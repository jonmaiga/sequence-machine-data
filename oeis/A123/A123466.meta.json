  "description": "Write the positive integer n in binary. Subdivide the binary n into runs each consisting entirely of 0's or of 1's, where the runs alternate between those of 1's and those of 0's. The sequence gives those numbers n such that there is at least one run of 1's of the same length as at least one run of 0's.",

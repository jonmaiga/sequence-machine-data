  "description": "Start with the seed a(0)=2. The minimum number, different from 1, that multiplied by 2 (seed) produces a number with 2 as its rightmost digit is a(1)=6. Then 6*2=12. Again, the minimum number that multiplied by 12 produces 12 as its rightmost digits is a(2)=26 (12*26=312). And so on.",

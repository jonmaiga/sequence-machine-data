  "description": "A polynomial of matrices is used to make a triangular sequence. The upper triangular antidiagonal Steinbach matrices are summed over their characteristic polynomial triangular sequences to give a new sequence of matrices: the characteristic polynomials of these new summed matrices are, then, used to make up this triangular sequence.",

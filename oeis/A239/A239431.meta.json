  "description": "Consider the sequence A235598. Recalling that A235598(n) forms part of a Pythagorean triple, a(n) states its relationship to both a(n-1) and a(n+1). 1 denotes the lesser leg, 2 denotes the greater leg and 3 denotes the hypotenuse. The tens place returns its relationship to the side to its left, a(n-1), and the units place its relationship to the side to its right, a(n+1). a(0)=1.",

  "description": "a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. Thereafter a(n) is least novel m satisfying: 1. If i = a(n-2) and j = a(n-1) are closed, choose m closed to i and open to j. 2. If i and j are open, choose m closed to h = a(n-3) and open to i + j, unless such a solution does not exist, in which case the constraint that m is closed to h is dropped, leaving a(n) as least novel m open to i + j.

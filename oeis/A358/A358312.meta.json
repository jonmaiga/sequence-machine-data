  "description": "Consider the graph of symmetric primes where p and q are connected if |p-q| = gcd(p-1,q-1). This sequence is an irregular table where the n-th row lists the first symmetric prime in a connected component with n vertices, with one representative for each nonisomorphic graph. Within a row, graphs are ordered by increasing size of its initial prime.",

  "description": "Let G(n) = gcd(a(n-2),a(n-1)), a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3. Thereafter if G(n) = 1, a(n) is the least novel m sharing a divisor with both a(n-2) and a(n-1). If G(n) > 1 and every prime divisor of a(n-1) also divides a(n-2), a(n) is the least m prime to both a(n-1) and a(n-2). Otherwise a(n) is the least novel multiple of any prime divisor of a(n-1) which does not divide a(n-2).",

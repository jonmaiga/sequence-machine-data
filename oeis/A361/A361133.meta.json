  "description": "a(n) = n for n <= 3. Let h, i, j represent a(n-3), a(n-2), a(n-1) respectively. For n > 3, if there is a symmetric difference in the sets of distinct primes dividing h and j, with greatest member p then a(n) is the least novel multiple of p. Otherwise, a(n) is the least novel k such that (k,i) > 1.",

  "description": "Let h,i,j be the latest 3 terms in the sequence, starting with a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3. Let R = rad(h*i*j), where rad is A007947, and let S be the smallest number of terms in U = {h,i,j} which are divisible by any prime p dividing R. Then, a(n) is the least novel multiple of the greatest such prime p.",

  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of Schroeder paths of length 2n and having k weak ascents (1<=k<=n). A Schroeder path of length 2n is a lattice path from (0,0) to (2n,0) consisting of U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and H=(2,0) steps and never going below the x-axis. A weak ascent in a Schroeder path is a maximal sequence of consecutive U and H steps.",

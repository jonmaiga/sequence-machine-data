  "description": "The present sequence depends on the index k of a Gaussian prime a + bi in A103431. Such an index k is a term of this sequence when an integer multiplier m exists such that m*norm(a+bi) lies in an interval of length 1 around the index k of a+bi in A103431: k - 1/2 < m*norm(a+bi) < k + 1/2.",

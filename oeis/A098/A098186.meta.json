  "description": "If f[x]=(sum of unitary-proper divisors of x)=A063919[x] is iterated, the iteration may lead to a fixed point which is either 0 or belongs to A002827, a unitary-perfect-number >1: 6,60,90,87360... Sequence gives initial values for which the iteration ends in 87360, the 4th unitary perfect number.",

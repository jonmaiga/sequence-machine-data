  "description": "Number of (k+1)-tuples of integers modulo n (x_1,...,x_k,s) such that at least one subset of the x_i sums to s mod n. In other words, n^k times the expected number of distinct subset sums mod n of k integers mod n chosen uniformly at random. Read by antidiagonals, i.e., with entries in the order (n,k)=(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1),...",

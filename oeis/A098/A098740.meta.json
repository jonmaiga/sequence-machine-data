  "description": "Start with the sequence of natural numbers S(0)={1,2,3,...} and define, for i>0, S(i)=D(i)S(i-1), where D(i)A denotes the operation of deleting the a(1+[i/2])th term of A={a(1),a(2),a(3),...}. E.g. D(3){1,2,4,6,9,10,...} means to delete the a(1+[3/2])th = 2nd term of {1,2,4,9,10,...}, giving {1,4,9,10,...}. The given sequence is the limit of S(i) as i->inf.",

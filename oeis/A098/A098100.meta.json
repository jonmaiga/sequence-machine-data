  "description": "Write each non-Fibonacci integer >0 on a single label. Put the labels in numerical order to form an infinite sequence L. Now consider the succession of single digits of A000045 (Fibonacci numbers): 1 1 2 3 5 8 1 3 2 1 3 4 5 5 8 9 1 4 4 2 3 3 3 7 7 6 1 0 9... The sequence S gives a rearrangement of the labels that reproduces the same succession of digits, subject to the constraint that the smallest label must be used that does not lead to a contradiction.",

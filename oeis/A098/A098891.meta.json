  "description": "Define the n-omino graph to be the graph whose vertices are each of the n-ominoes, two of which are joined by an edge if one can be obtained from the other by cutting out one of the latter's component squares (thus obtaining an (n-1)-omino for most cases) and gluing it elsewhere. The sequence counts the edges in these graphs.",

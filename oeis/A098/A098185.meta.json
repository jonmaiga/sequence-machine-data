  "description": "If f(x) = (sum of unitary proper divisors of x) = A063919(x) is iterated, the iteration may lead to a fixed point which is either equals 0 or it is from A002827, a unitary perfect number > 1: 6,60,90,87360... Here initial values are collected for which the iteration ends in a unitary perfect number > 1.",

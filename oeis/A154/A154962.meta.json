  "description": "The terms of this sequence are integer values of consecutive denominators (with signs) from the fractional expansion (using only fractions with numerators to be positive 1's) of the BBP polynomial ( 4/(8*k+1) - 2/(8*k+4) - 1/(8*k+5) - 1/(8*k+6) ) for all k (starting from 0 to infinity); for k>=1 the Erdos-Straus conjecture is applied to the first fraction - so it is always replaced by exactly three fractions.",

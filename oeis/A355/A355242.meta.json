  "description": "T(w,h) is the minimum integer slope >= 1 that can be chosen as orientation of a w X h rectangle such that the upper bound for the minimum number of covered grid points A354702(w,d) can be achieved by a suitable translation of the rectangle, where T(w,h) and A354702 are triangles read by rows. T(w,h) = -1 if no integer slope satisfying this condition exists.",

  "description": "T(w,h)/2 is the minimum slope >= 1/2 that can be chosen as orientation of a w X h rectangle such that the lower bound for the maximum number of covered grid points A354704(w,d) can be achieved by a suitable translation of the rectangle, where T(w,h) and A354704 are triangles read by rows. T(w,h) = -1 if no slope satisfying this condition exists.",

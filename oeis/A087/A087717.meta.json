  "description": "Start with x=n, then iterate the map x -> A322982(x) with A322982(x)=2*x-1 if x is noncomposite, otherwise A322982(x) = A032742(x), the largest proper divisor of x. If this iteration leads to a fixed point then a(n) is the value of that fixed point. If the iteration leads to a cycle, a(n) is the smallest value in the cycle. If the iteration never becomes periodic then a(n)=0.",

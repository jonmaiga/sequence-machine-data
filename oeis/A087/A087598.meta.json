  "description": "Define dd(k) = the number formed by concatenating the absolute difference of successive digits of k. Triangular numbers t such that dd(t)= say, r, dd(r) = s and so on Then t,r,s etc. are triangular numbers until a single-digit triangular number (0,1,3,or 6 ) arises. (Triangular number in which the number formed by successive digit difference is also a triangular number at every step which finally ends up in a one-digit triangular number.).",

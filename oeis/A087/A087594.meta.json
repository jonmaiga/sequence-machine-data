  "description": "Define dd(n) = the number formed by concatenating the absolute difference of successive digits. Sequence contains primes p such that dd(p)=q is a prime, dd(q) is also a prime = r and so on until a single-digit prime (2,3,5,7) arises. (Primes in which the number formed by successive digit differences are primes at every step until a single-digit prime is obtained.).",

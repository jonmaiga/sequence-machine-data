  "description": "Numbers n that cannot be decomposed into the sum of at most 4 square numbers when using the following algorithm: Repeat the following 2 steps 4 times: 1-find the largest square s smaller than n; 2-n=n-s Numbers that can be decomposed yield final values of n=0. The sequence presented is of those numbers where n is not 0 when this algorithm ends.",

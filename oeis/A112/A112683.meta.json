  "description": "For each positive integer n, consider the ternary sequence given initially by x(i) = 0 if 1 <= i < n, x(n) = 1; and thereafter determined by the quadratic recurrence x(i) = x(i-1) + x(i-n)^2 mod 3. Define a(n) to be the smallest positive integer N for which x(N+i) = x(i) for all sufficiently large i.",

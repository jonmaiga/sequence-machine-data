  "description": "a(n) is the number of distinct primes produced by starting with the n-th prime p and repeatedly looking at all the prime factors of 2p-1, and then performing the same process (double, subtract 1, find all prime factors) with those primes; a(n) = -1 if this produces infinitely many primes.",

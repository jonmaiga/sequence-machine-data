  "description": "For any number k >= 0, let T_k be the triangle with values in {-1, 0, +1} whose base corresponds to the balanced ternary expansion of k (without leading zeros) and other values, say t above u and v, satisfy t+u+v = 0 mod 3; the balanced ternary expansion of a(n) corresponds to the left border of T_n (the most significant digit being at the bottom left corner).",

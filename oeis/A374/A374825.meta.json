  "description": "Place n equally spaced points on the circumference of a circle of radius r and then connect each pair of points with straight lines whose intersections create A007569(n) - n additional points. Draw a circle of radius r around each of the A007569(n) points. The sequence gives the total number of vertices formed from all circle intersections.",

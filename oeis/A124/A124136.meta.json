  "description": "a(n) is the smallest prime when larger number of primes arise between numbers and their doubles. Note for example that there are 8 primes between 34 and 2*34=68 and 35 and 2*35=70, but 34 and 35 are not primes and a(8)=37, which is the smallest prime where there are already nine primes between numbers 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44, 47, 48 and their doubles.",

  "description": "Odd degrees for which (up to swapping of variables) there exists a unique polynomial p(x,y), such that p(x,y)=1 when x+y=1, with positive coefficients and such that the number of terms is minimal (equal to (d+3)/2). There always exists a group invariant polynomial (see any of the references), but for many degrees, other such extremal polynomials exist.",

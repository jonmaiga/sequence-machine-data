  "description": "Let g_0(x,y)=x, g_1(x,y)=x^3+3xy and g_{n+2}(x,y) = (x^2+2y)g_{n+1}(x+y)-y^2g_n(x,y). The entries of the sequence are those odd d for which g_d(x,y) and cx^jy^kg_m(x,y) have at least two terms in common (same coefficients) for some c > 0 and integers j,k and such that g_d(x,y) + cx^jy^k(1+y^m - g_m(x,y)) has all positive coefficients.",

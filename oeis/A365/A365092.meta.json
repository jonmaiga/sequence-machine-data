  "description": "Write out the canonical factorization of n and factorize the exponents in the factorization, the exponents in the factorizations of the exponents, ... until there are only prime numbers left. Replace each p in the factorization by (p-1)+1 and factorize each p-1 by the same process if p-1 > 1. Continue this process until there are only 1s left. a(n) is the number of 1s used.",

  "description": "Triangle T(n, k), n >= 0, k = 0..n, read by rows: let's consider a triangle of initially empty glasses of equal volume, G(n, k), n >= 0, k = 0..n; when water is poured into one of the glasses, say G(n, k), it flows into that glass until it's full, and then the excess overflows equally into G(n+1, k) and G(n+1, k+1); let V(n, k) be the minimum volume of water to be poured into G(0, 0) so as to fill G(n, k) completely; T(n, k) is the numerator of V(n, k) / V(0, 0).",

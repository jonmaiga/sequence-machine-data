  "description": "Exact differential base (a B_2 sequence) constructed as follows: Start with a(0)=0. For n>=1, let S be the set of all differences a(j)-a(i) for 0 <= i < j <= n-1, and let d be the smallest positive integer not in S. If, for every i in 1..n-1, a(n-1) + d - a(i) is not in S, then a(n) = a(n-1) + d. Otherwise, let r be the smallest positive integer such that, for every i in 1..n-1, neither a(n-1) + r - a(i) nor a(n-1) + r + d - a(i) is in S; then a(n) = a(n-1) + r and a(n+1) = a(n) + d.",

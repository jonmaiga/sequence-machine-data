  "description": "Start to read the sequence digit by digit and erase the first \"1\" you encounter, then the first \"2\", the first \"3\", etc., until the first \"0\"; go on from there and erase again the first \"1\", the first \"2\", etc., until \"0\" -- and so on, cyclically until the end of the (infinite) sequence. Concatenate what is left. The result is the concatenation of all integers of the sequence.",

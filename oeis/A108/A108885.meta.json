  "description": "Let T(m,p) be the value of the following game: there are m \"minus\" balls and p \"plus\" balls in an urn, for a total of n=m+p balls. You may draw balls from the urn one at a time at random and without replacement until you decide to stop drawing. Each minus ball drawn costs you $1 and each plus ball drawn gets you $1. Sequence gives triangle of numerators of T(n-p,p), 0 <= p <= n, read by rows.",

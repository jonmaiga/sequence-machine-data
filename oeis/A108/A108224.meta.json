  "description": "Suppose you take the ten digits 0..9, arrange them in any order and then either concatenate adjacent ones or separate them with a plus or minus sign, e.g., 98-76+5-4-32+10 or 9-8-765+3041-2. The first expression totals to \"1\", the second example totals to \"2275\". This sequence lists the positive integers that cannot be expressed in this way.",

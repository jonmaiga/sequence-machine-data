  "description": "a(1) = 2. For n>1, let k = largest integer such that the word a(1)a(2)...a(n-1) is of the form xy^k for words x and y (where y has positive length), i.e., the maximal number of repeating blocks at the end of the sequence so far. If k>1, a(n) = k. If k=1, choose a(n) so that the next k (that for a(1),...,a(n)) is as large as possible and if there is more than one choice for this a(n), pick the smallest.",

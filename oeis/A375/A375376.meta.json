  "description": "Square array read by antidiagonals: Let n = Sum_{i=1..m} 2^e_i be the binary expansion of n, let S be the set {e_i+2; 1 <= i <= m}, and let X be the sequence of power towers built of numbers in S, sorted first by their height and then colexicographically. The n-th row of the array gives the permutation of indices which reorders X by magnitude. In case of ties, keep the colexicographic order.",

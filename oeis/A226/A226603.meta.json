  "description": "Let c(n) be the n-th number in the sequence of odd composite numbers that are not squares of primes, and let p = c(n)*2^k + 1 (with k > 0) and m be the smallest integer satisfying congruence 2^m == 1 (mod p). The number a(n) is the least k such that p is prime and c(n) does not divide m, or 0 if no such value exists.",

  "description": "A triple of positive integers (n,p,k) is admissible if there exist at least two different multisets of k positive integers, {x_1,x_2,...,x_k} and {y_1,y_2,...,y_k}, such that x_1+x_2+...+x_k = y_1+y_2+...+y_k = n and x_1x_2...x_k = y_1y_2...y_k = p. For each n, let A(n) = {p:(n,p,k) is admissible for some k}, and let a(n) = |A(n)|.",

  "description": "In the sequence of nonprime numbers, an element k's position is either prime or nonprime. If k's position is prime, f(k)= the k-th nonprime-positioned element, else f(k) is the k-th prime-positioned element. Iterated application of x-> f(x) gives disjoint sequences generated by the first elements, which form the current sequence.",

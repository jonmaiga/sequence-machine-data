  "description": "Consider the sequence of binary words of integers, LSB to MSB S(k) = ( 0; 1; 01; 11; 001; 101; 011; ... ). Start with a(0) = 0, extend this sequence with the minimum number of [0;1] such that it contains S(1) then S(2) and so forth, as sub-strings with LSB at any a(n). We extend the sequence as much as required to include S(k) first, in the next step we extend until it includes S(k+1) too.",

  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of permutations p of [n] such that the number of inversions of the word formed by the leading entries of the blocks of p is k. A block of a permutation is a maximal sequence of consecutive integers which appear in consecutive positions. For example, the permutation 5412367 has 4 blocks: 5, 4, 123, and 67; their leading entries are 5,4,1, and 6 and the word 5416 has 3 inversions.",

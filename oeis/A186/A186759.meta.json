  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} having k cycles that are either nonincreasing or of length 1 (0<=k<=n). A cycle (b(1), b(2), ...) is said to be increasing if, when written with its smallest element in the first position, it satisfies b(1) < b(2) < b(3) < ... .",

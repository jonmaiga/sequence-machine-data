  "description": "Write the positive multiples of 3 on labels in numerical order, forming an infinite sequence L. Now consider the succession of single digits of L: 3 6 9 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 1 2 4 2 7 3 0 3 3 3 6 3 9 4 2 .... This sequence is a derangement of L that produces the same succession of digits, subject to the constraint that the smallest unused label must be used that does not lead to a contradiction.",

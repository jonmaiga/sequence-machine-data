  "description": "Write the positive even integers on labels in numerical order, forming an infinite sequence L. Consider the succession of digits of L: 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 4 2 6 2 8 3 0 ... (A036211). This sequence gives a derangement of L that produces the same succession of digits, subject to the constraint that the smallest unused label must be used that does not lead to a contradiction.",

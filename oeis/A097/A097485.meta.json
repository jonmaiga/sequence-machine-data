  "description": "Write the positive integers on labels in numerical order, forming an infinite sequence L. Consider now the succession of single digits made by juxtaposing Fibonacci numbers: 1 1 2 3 5 8 1 3 2 1 3 4 5 5 ... (A031324). This sequence gives a derangement of L that produces the same succession of digits, subject to the constraint that the smallest unused label must be used that does not lead to a contradiction.",

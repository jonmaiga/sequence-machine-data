  "description": "Let k(m) denote the least integer such that every m X m (0,1)-matrix with exactly k(m) ones in each row and in each column contains a 2 X 2 submatrix without zeros. The sequence gives the index n of the first term in each string of equal entries in the {k(m)} sequence (see A155934).",

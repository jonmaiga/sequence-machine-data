  "description": "Two numbers k and l we call equivalent if they have the same vector of exponents with positive components in prime power factorization. Let a(1)=1, a(2)=3. If n>=3 is prime, then a(n) is the smallest prime greater than a(n-1); otherwise, a(n)>a(n-1) is the smallest number equivalent to n such that prime power factorization of a(n) contains only primes which already appeared in the sequence.",

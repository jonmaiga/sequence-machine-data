  "description": "a(n) gives the number of conjugacy classes in the permutation group generated by transposition (1 2) and double n-cycle (1 3 5 7 ... 2n-1)(2 4 6 8 ... 2n). This group is a semidirect product formed by a cyclic group acting on an elementary abelian 2-group of rank n by cyclically permuting the factors.",

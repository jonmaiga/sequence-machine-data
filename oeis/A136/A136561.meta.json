  "description": "Triangle read by rows: n-th diagonal (from the right) is the sequence of (signed) differences between pairs of consecutive terms in the (n-1)th diagonal. The rightmost diagonal (A136562) is defined: A136562(1)=1; A136562(n) is the smallest integer > A136562(n-1) such that any (signed) integer occurs at most once in the triangle A136561.",

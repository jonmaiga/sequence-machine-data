  "description": "The number of ways to color n balls in a row with 3 colors with no color runs having lengths greater than 4. This sequence is a special case of the general problem for coloring n balls in a row with p colors where each color has a given maximum run-length. In this example, the bounds are uniformly 4. It can be phrased in terms of tossing a p-faced die n times, requiring each face to have no runs longer than b.",

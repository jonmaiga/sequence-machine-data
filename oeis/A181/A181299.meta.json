  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of 2-compositions of n having k columns in which the top entry is equal to the bottom entry (0<=k<=floor(n/2)). A 2-composition of n is a nonnegative matrix with two rows, such that each column has at least one nonzero entry and whose entries sum up to n.",

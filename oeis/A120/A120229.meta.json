  "description": "Split-floor-multiplier sequence (SFMS) using multipliers 1/3 and 3. The SFMS using multipliers r and s is here introduced: for every positive integer n and positive real number r, let [rn] abbreviate floor(rn). Then SFMS(r, s), where max {r, s} > 1, is the sequence a defined by a(n)=[rn] if [rn] > 0 and is not already in a and a(n) = [sn] otherwise.",

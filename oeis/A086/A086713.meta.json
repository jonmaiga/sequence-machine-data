  "description": "A squarefree sequence: define a mapping from the set of strings over the alphabet {0,1,2} by f(0)=01201, f(1)=020121, f(2)=0212021 and f of the concatenation of s and t is the concatenation of f(s) and f(t). Then each of 0, f(0), f(f(0)), ... is an initial substring of the next; their limit is the infinite sequence given above.",

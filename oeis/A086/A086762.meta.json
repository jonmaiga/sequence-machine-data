  "description": "A piecewise recurrence relation with a(2)=7 and for n>=2: if a(n) is prime, not 31, a(n+1) = A000265(3*a(n)+1); if a(n) is odd composite, not 1, a(n+1) = A000265(a(n)+1); if a(n) is even, a(n+1) = A000265(a(n)); if a(n) is 1 or 31, find the number S(n) of occurrences of 1 and 31 among a(2),a(3),...,a(n) and compute a(n+1) by the above rules as if a(n) were 2+S(n), unless 2+S(n)=31, in which case a(n+1)=47.",

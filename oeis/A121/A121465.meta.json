  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of nondecreasing Dyck paths of semilength n such that the sum of the heights of their triangles is k (0<=k<=n). A triangle in a Dyck path is a subpath of the form U^h D^h, starting at the x-axis; here U=(1,1), D=(1,-1), h being the height of the triangle.",

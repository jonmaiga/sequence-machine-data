  "description": "a(n) gives the number of iterations of x -> A003415(x) needed to reach the first number which is either a divisor or multiple of n, but not both at the same time. If no such number can ever be reached, a(n) is 0 (when either n is of the form p^p, or if the iteration would never stop). When the number reached is a divisor of n, a(n) is -1 * iteration count.",

  "description": "Coefficients of Chebyshev T(x,n) constructed polynomials that are based on a Cumrun Vafa type of Calabi-Yau crystal (binomials of this type would behave much like Chladni standing waves): p(x,n,m)=T(x,n)*T(x,m)+T(x,n)+T(x,m): binomials are: p(x,y,n,m)=T(x,n)*T(y,m)+T(x,n)+T(y,m). Integrate(p(x,n,m)/sqrt[1-x^2),{x,-1,1}]=0 if n,m>0 and n does not equal m: for n=m the result is Pi/2: they are orthogonal polynomials.",

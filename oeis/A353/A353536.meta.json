  "description": "a(n) is the cardinality of the set S(n) obtained by the following process: Start with the set S(0) = {i}, where i is the imaginary unit. In step n, the set S(n) is the union of all Gaussian integers obtained by the m*(m+1)/2 sums and the m*(m+1)/2 products formed with the pairs of numbers in the Cartesian product S(n-1) x S(n-1) with m = card(S(n-1)).",

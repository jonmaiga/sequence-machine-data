  "description": "Counts 2-wild partitions. In general p-wild partitions of n are defined so that they are in bijection with geometric equivalence classes of degree n algebra extensions of the p-adic field Q_p. Here two algebra extensions are equivalent if they become isomorphic after tensoring with the maximal unramified extension of Q_p.",

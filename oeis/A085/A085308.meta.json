  "description": "Iterate function described in A085308 (= reverse concatenation of prime factors); a(n) is either 1# the fixed point[=prime] if it exists at all: 2# a(2k)=1 labels that no convergence with most even initial values, in contrary mostly rapid divergence is the case; 3# a(n)=0 if n=1 or if the iteration results in nontrivial attractor with cycle length larger than one.",

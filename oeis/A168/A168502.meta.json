  "description": "For each permutation of {1,2,...,n} one or more integers might not be part of any longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of that permutation. The sequence lists the number of permutations for which ceiling(n/2) is not part of any LIS. For example, if n=4, 2 is not in any LIS of the two permutations (1342) and (3421).",

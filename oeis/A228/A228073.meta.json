  "description": "Degrees of special cubic divisors C_i. Each C_i corresponds to the collection of cubic fourfolds in the complex projective space of dimension 5, and these cubic fourfolds are indexed by i (i.e., of degree i). For each index i, the degree can be interpreted as the number of such cubic fourfolds.",

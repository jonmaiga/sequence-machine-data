  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} whose 2nd cycle has k entries; each cycle is written with the smallest element first and cycles are arranged in increasing order of their first elements (n>=1; 0<=k<=n-1). For example, 1432=(1)(24)(3) has 2 entries in the 2nd cycle; 3421=(1324) has 0 entries in the 2nd cycle.",

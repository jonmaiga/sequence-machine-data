  "description": "Sequencing of all multinomial coefficients arranged in an s X r array of Pascal simplices P(s,r) and sequenced along the array's antidiagonals. Each P(s,r) is, in turn, a sequence of terms representing the coefficients of a_1,...,a_s in the expansion of (Sum_{i=1..s} a_i)^r with r starting at zero.",

  "description": "Let {s(i)}, i=0,1,2,... be a sequence of finite sequences with terms s(i)(j), j=1,2,3,... Start with s(0)={1}. Then, for k>0, let s(k) = s(k-1) U s(k-1) if s(k-1)(k)=0, s(k) = s(k-1) U {0} U s(k-1) if s(k-1)(k)=1, where s(i)(j) is the j-th element of s(i) and U denotes concatenation of the terms of the two operands. {a(n)} is the limit of s(k) as k goes to infinity.",

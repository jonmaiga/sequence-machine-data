  "description": "Number of permutations of the divisors of n that are greater than 1, in which consecutive elements are not coprime and no divisor d may occur later than any divisor e if e < d and A007947(e) = A007947(d). That is, any subset of divisors sharing the same squarefree part occur always in ascending order inside the permutation.",

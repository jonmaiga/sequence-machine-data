  "description": "Let P be the sequence of distinct lattice points defined by the following rules: P(1) = (0,0), P(2) = (1,0), and for any i < j < k, P(k) does not lie on the vector (P(i), P(j)), and for any n > 2, P(n) is the closest lattice point to P(n-1) such that the angle of the vectors (P(n-2), P(n-1)) and (P(n-1), P(n)), say t, satisfies 0 < t < Pi, and in case of a tie, minimize the angle t; a(n) = X-coordinate of P(n).",

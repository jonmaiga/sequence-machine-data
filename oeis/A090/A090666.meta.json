  "description": "Number of repetitions (defined as the number of appearances minus one) of L quantum number for a given value of N=2*nb+tau=0,1,2,... principal quantum number for the 5 dimensional harmonic oscillator (connected to the solution of Bohr equation in 5 dimensional). For each tau, nu=0,1,..,[tau/3] and K=tau-2*nu. Finally L=K,K+1,K+2,...,2*K-2,2*K (or alternatively from K to 2*K with the exception of 2*K-1).",

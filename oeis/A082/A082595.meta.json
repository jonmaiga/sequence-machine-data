  "description": "Let QR be the set of quadratic residues mod n: QR = {x^2 mod n, 1 <= x <= n-1}. Let MR be the set of values taken by 2^x mod n: MR = {2^x mod n, 0 <= x <= n-2}. Usually if QR is a subset of MR then n is prime and otherwise n is composite. Sequence gives numbers that violate this rule, i.e., composites where QR is a subset of MR and primes where QR is not a subset of MR.",

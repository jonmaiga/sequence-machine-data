Then enter numbers in this order: a(1, 2), a(2, 1), a(3, 1), a(2, 2), a(1, 3), a(1, 4), a(2, 3), a(3, 2), a(4, 1), a(5, 1), a(4, 2), ... such that every entry is the smallest not yet used and such that every entry greater than 1 has a common divisor with its neighbors (in all directions) which are greater than 1.",

  "description": "Number of numbers k which give 1 after applying exactly n iterations of the 3k+1 algorithm (if a number is even, divide it by 2; if it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1). This total includes numbers k which also give 1 for a smaller number of iterations (i.e., for this sequence we do not assume the algorithm halts when 1 is reached).",

  "description": "Irregular triangle T(n,k) read by rows: Let S be a 3-member set of integers {f,g,h} where f >= g >= h >= 0 and f+g+h = n. Let S(n,k) be an irregular triangle composed of all S listed in reverse lexicographic order by row n. Then T(n,k) = n!*Q/(3*f!*g!*h!), where Q is the number of permutations of S(n,k). (See \"Comments\" and \"Examples\" for additional explanation.)",

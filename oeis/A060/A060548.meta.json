  "description": "a(n) is the number of D3-symmetric patterns that may be formed with a top-down equilateral triangular arrangement of closely packed black and white cells satisfying the local matching rule of Pascal's triangle modulo 2, where n is the number of cells in each edge of the arrangement. The matching rule is such that any elementary top-down triangle of three neighboring cells in the arrangement contains either one or three white cells.",

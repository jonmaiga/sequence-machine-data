  "description": "Sequence of adjacent transpositions (a[n] a[n]+1), which, when starting from the identity permutation and applied successively, produce a Hamiltonian circuit through all permutations of S_4, in such a way that S_{n-1} is always traversed before the rest of S_n. Furthermore, each subsequence from the first to the (n!-1)-th term is palindromic.",

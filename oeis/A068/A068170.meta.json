Given the first term, called the seed (the seed need not have the property of the remaining terms of the sequence), subsequent terms are defined as obtained by inserting/placing digits (at least one) in the previous term to obtain the smallest number with a given property. This is the growing prime sequence for the seed a(1) = 5.",

  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} with excedance set equal to the k-th subset of {1,2,...,n-1} (n>=0, 0<=k<=ceiling(2^(n-1))-1). The subsets of {1,2,...,n-1} are ordered according to size, while the subsets of the same size follow the lexicographic order.",

  "description": "This is a sequence demonstrating a congruence property of second order exponential functions. Let f(n) = a^(b^n) + c where a,b,c & n belong to N, a, b & c fixed. Then f(n + k*phi(phi(f(n)) is congruent to 0 (mod(f(n)). Here k belongs to N. This is a sequence of quotients generated by f(n + k*f(n))/f(n) when a & b = 2, c= 3 and n = 1. when a & b = 2 and c =3 when n = 1.",

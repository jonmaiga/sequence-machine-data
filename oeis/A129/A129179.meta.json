  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of Schroeder paths of semilength n such that the area between the x-axis and the path is k (n>=0; 0<=k<=n^2). A Schroeder path of semilength n is a lattice path from (0,0) to (2n,0) consisting of U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and H=(2,0) steps and never going below the x-axis.",

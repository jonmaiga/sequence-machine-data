  "description": "Pulsating Checkpoint Sequence: use powers of 2 as checkpoints; place powers of 2, starting with 4, with spacing equal to the previous power of 2. Whenever we encounter a checkpoint, we jump over it; otherwise, we insert four numbers into the sequence: 2p, p, 3p, and 3p+3, where p is the smallest odd prime not yet in the sequence.",

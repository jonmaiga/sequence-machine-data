  "description": "Starting at n, a(n) is the smallest distance from zero for which the next move is a step away from zero, or zero if no such move is ever made, according to the following rules. On the k-th step (k=1,2,3,...) move a distance of k in the direction of zero. If the number landed on has been landed on before, move a distance of k away from zero instead.",

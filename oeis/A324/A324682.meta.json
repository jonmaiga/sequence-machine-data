  "description": "Starting at n, a(n) is the sign of the closest nonzero point to zero visited for which the next move is a step away from zero, according to the following rules. On the k-th step (k=1,2,3,...) move a distance of k in the direction of zero. If the number landed on has been landed on before, move a distance of k away. In the case of a tie, or if the set of points is empty, we set a(n)=0.",

  "description": "Average number of steps t(n) required to get n by repeatedly toggling one of the ceiling(log_2(n)) bits of the binary result of the previous step at a random position with equal probability of the bit positions, starting with all bits 0. The fractional part of t is given separately, i.e., t(n) = a(n) + A324496(n)/A324497(n).",

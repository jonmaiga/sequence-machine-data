  "description": "a(n) gives the number of steps taken in a process which manipulates piles of tokens arranged in a line. There are 2n (or 2n+1) tokens in all. Initially they are all in one pile. At each step every pile with more than 1 token is divided into two and half the token are added to the pile on the left and half to the pile on the right. If a pile has an odd number of tokens, the token left over stays where it is. The redistributions in each step are done in parallel.",

  "description": "Square array read by antidiagonals: W(m,n) (m >= 0, n >= 0) is the Wiener index of the graph G(m,n) obtained in the following way: connect by an edge the center of an m-edge star with the center of an n-edge star. The Wiener index of a connected graph is the sum of distances between all unordered pairs of vertices in the graph.",

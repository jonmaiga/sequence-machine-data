  "description": "Let S be a strictly monotonic sequence of length 2n and let p and q be subsequences of S each of length n such that the least element belongs to p and every element of S belongs to either p or q. The number of ways to select p such that for any index i the exchange of p(i) and q(i) makes at least one of p and q non-monotonic, is given by a(n).",

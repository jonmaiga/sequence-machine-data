  "description": "Integrals of the absolute value of the Z function between successive zeros greater than or equal to the integral corresponding to 12. If we define the normalized Z function by z(x) = Z(2*Pi*x/log(2)), then the 33rd and 34th zeros are approximately 11.82 and 12.25. Integrating |z(x)| between these values gives a quantity I and the above sequence is defined as the midpoints of all successive zeros of z(x) such that the integral of |z(x)| is greater than or equal to I.",

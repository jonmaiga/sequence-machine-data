  "description": "The number of 3D configurations of a labeled size 2*n \"wurfel\". A wurfel consists of a series of cubes held together on a looped string such that the string makes a right angle inside each cube. Ignoring the labels would make a wurfel a special kind of polycube in which the cubes can be cyclically ordered at consecutive right angles (equivalently, avoiding 3 consecutive collinear cubes).",

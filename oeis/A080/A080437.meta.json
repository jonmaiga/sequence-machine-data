  "description": "For n < 5, a(n) = n-th prime. For n >= 5, let m = n-th prime. If m is a k-digit prime then a(n) = smallest prime obtained by inserting at least one digit between every pair of digits of m. There are (k-1) places where digit insertion takes place and a(n) contains at least 2k-1 digits.",

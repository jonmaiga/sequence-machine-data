  "description": "The n-th row of the following triangle contains n distinct primes such that the product of (n-1) of them + 2 is prime in all cases. The first (n-1) numbers are the smallest set whose product +2 is a prime and the n-th term is chosen to satisfy the requirement. a(1) = 2 by convention. Sequence contains the triangle by rows.",

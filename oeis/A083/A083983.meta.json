  "description": "If k is a number with exactly two distinct decimal digits, say a and b, neither of which is 0 (i.e., a member of A101594), define the self-complement of k, SC(k), to be the number obtained by replacing a with b and vice versa. E.g. SC(232233) = 323322. Sequence contains primes p such that SC(p) is also a prime.",

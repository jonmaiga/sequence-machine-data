  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(j,k) is the number of acyclic functions from {1,...,j} to {1,...,k}. For n >= 1, a(n) = (k-j)*k^(j-1), where k is such that C(k,2) < n <= C(k+1,2) and j = (n-1) mod C(k,2). Alternatively, table T(k,j) read by antidiagonals with k >= 1, 0 <= j <= k: T(k,j) = number of acyclic-function digraphs on k vertices with j vertices of outdegree 1 and (k-j) vertices of outdegree 0; T(k,j) = (k-j)*k^(j-1).",

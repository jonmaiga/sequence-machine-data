  "description": "a(n) is the binary number (shown here in decimal) constructed from quadratic residues of 65537 in range [(n^2)+1,(n+1)^2] in such a way that quadratic residues are mapped to 1-bits, and non-quadratic residues (as well as the multiples of 65537) to 0-bits, with the lower end of range mapped to less significant, and the higher end of range to more significant bits.",

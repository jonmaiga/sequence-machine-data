  "description": "Use the MÃ¶bius (or Moebius) function mu(n) (A008683) to define a walk on a square lattice. A value of 1 is a move to the right, a value of -1 is a move to the left, and a value of 0 is a move either up or down depending on whether the previous nonzero value was +1 or -1. Sequence lists moves which reach a point that is further from the origin than any earlier move.",

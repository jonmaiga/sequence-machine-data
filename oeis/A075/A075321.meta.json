  "description": "Pair the odd primes so that the n-th pair is (p, p+2n) where p is the smallest prime not included earlier such that p and p+2n are primes and p+2n also does not occur earlier: (3, 5), (7, 11), (13, 19), (23, 31), (37, 47), (17, 29), (53, 67) ... This is the sequence of the first member of every pair.",

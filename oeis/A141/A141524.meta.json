  "description": "Consider the array T(n, m) where the n-th row is the sequence of integer coefficients of A(x), where 1<=a(n)<=n, such that A(x)^(1/n) consists entirely of integer coefficients and where m is the (m+1)-th coefficient. This is the table in the example of A112283 read term by term, row by row.",

  "description": "Nearest integer to the space diagonal of the smallest (measured by the longest edge) primitive (gcd(a,b,c)=1) Euler bricks (a, b, c, sqrt(a^2 + b^2), sqrt(b^2 + c^2), sqrt(a^2 + c^2) are integers). If the space diagonal is an integer then the Euler brick is called a \"perfect cuboid\". There are no known perfect cuboids.",

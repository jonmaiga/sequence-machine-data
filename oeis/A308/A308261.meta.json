  "description": "For any integer n, let d(n) be the smallest k > 0 such that at least one of n-k or n+k is a prime number; we build an undirected graph G on top of the prime numbers as follows: two consecutive prime numbers p and q are connected iff at least one of d(p) or d(q) equals q-p; a(n) is the number of terms in the n-th connected component of G (ordered by least element).",

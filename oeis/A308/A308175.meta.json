  "description": "Let EM denote the Ehrenfeucht-Mycielski sequence A038219, and let P(n) = [EM(1),...,EM(n)]. To compute EM(n+1) for n>=3, we find the longest suffix S (say) of P(n) which has previously appeared in P(n). Suppose the most recent appearance of S began at index n-t(n). Then a(n) = t(n), while the length of S is given in A308174.",

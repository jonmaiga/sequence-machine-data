  "description": "Let N(k, d_i) be the number of digits d_i in the decimal expansion of k, and let M(k, p_j) be the multiplicity of a prime factor p_j of k. The sequence lists the numbers k such that, for any digit d_i, there exists at least a prime factor p_j where N(k,d_i) = M(k,p_j), and for any prime factor p_j there exists at least a digit d_i where M(k,p_j) = N(k,d_i).",

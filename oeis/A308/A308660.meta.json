  "description": "For any Gaussian integer z, let d(z) be the distance from z to the nearest Gaussian prime distinct from z; we build an undirected graph G on top of the Gaussian prime numbers as follows: two Gaussian prime numbers p and q are connected iff at least one of d(p) or d(q) equals the distance from p to q; a(n) is the number of elements in the connected component of G containing A002145(n).",

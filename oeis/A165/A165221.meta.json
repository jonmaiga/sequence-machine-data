  "description": "The Padovan sequence analog of the Fibonacci \"rabbit\" constant binary expansion. Starting with 0 and using the transitions 0->1,1->10,10->01 the subsequences 0,1,10,01,110,1001,01110,1101001,100101110,011101101001... are formed where each subsequence has P sub n ones and length P sub (n-1) binary digits, where P sub n is the n-th Padovan number. This sequence is the concatenation of all the subsequences. Also note that the n-th subsequence is the concatenation of the n-th-3 and n-th-2 subsequences.",

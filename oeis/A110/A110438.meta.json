  "description": "Triangular array giving the number of NSEW unit step lattice paths of length n with terminal height k subject to the following restrictions. The paths start at the origin (0,0) and take unit steps (0,1)=N(north), (0,-1)=S(south), (1,0)=E(east) and (-1,0)=W(west) such that no paths pass below the x-axis, no paths begin with W, all W steps remain on the x-axis and there are no NS steps.",

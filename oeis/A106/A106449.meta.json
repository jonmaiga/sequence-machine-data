  "description": "Square array (P(x) XOR P(y))/gcd(P(x),P(y)) where P(x) and P(y) are polynomials with coefficients in {0,1} given by the binary expansions of x and y, and all calculations are done in polynomial ring GF(2)[X], with the result converted back to a binary number, and then expressed in decimal. Array is symmetric, and is read by antidiagonals.",

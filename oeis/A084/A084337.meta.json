  "description": "Rearrangement of positive integers so that the successive ratios (of the larger to the smaller term) are all distinct integers. a(m)/a(m-1) = a(k)/a(k-1) iff m = k (assuming a(m) > a(m-1), otherwise the ratio a(m-1)/a(m) is to be considered). Priority is given to smallest number not included earlier rather than to the successive ratio that has not occurred earlier.",

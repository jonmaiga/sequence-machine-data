  "description": "a(1)=1. Skipping over integers occurring earlier in the sequence, count down a composite from a(n) to get a(n+1) so that a(n+1) is the smallest possible positive integer arrived at this way. If there are no positive integers at a distance of a composite number of yet unused integers, instead count up from a(n) 4 (the lowest composite positive integer) positions (skipping already occurring integers) to get a(n+1).",

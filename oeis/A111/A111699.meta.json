  "description": "a(1)=1. Skipping over integers occurring earlier in the sequence, count down b(n) (b(n)= number of earlier terms of {a(k)} which are coprime to n) from a(n-1) to get a(n). If this is <= 0, instead count up from a(n-1) b(n) positions (skipping already occurring integers) to get a(n).",

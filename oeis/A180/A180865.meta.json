  "description": "Square array read by antidiagonals: T(m,n) is the Wiener index of the stacked book graph B(m,n) (m>=1, n>=1). B(m,n) is defined as the graph Cartesian product S(m+1) x P(n), where S(m+1) is the star graph on m+1 nodes and P(n) is the path graph on n nodes. The Wiener index of a connected graph is the sum of distances between all unordered pairs of nodes in the graph.",

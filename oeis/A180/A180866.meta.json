  "description": "Square array read by antidiagonals: T(n,k) is the Wiener index of the firecracker graph F(n,k) (n>=1, k>=2). F(n,k) is the graph obtained by the concatenation of n k-stars by linking one leaf from each. The Wiener index of a connected graph is the sum of distances between all unordered pairs of vertices in the graph.",

  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of unordered pairs of nodes at distance k in the Moebius ladder M(n) (entries in row n are the coefficients of the corresponding Wiener polynomial). The Moebius ladder M(n) (n>=3) is the graph obtained from the cycle graph C(2n) by adding new edges joining each pair of opposite nodes.",

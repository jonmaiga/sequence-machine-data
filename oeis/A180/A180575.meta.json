  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of unordered pairs of nodes at distance k in the prism graph C_n X P_3 with the edges of the outer cycle removed (called a web graph). Equivalently, the graph is obtained by attaching a pendant edge to each node of the outer cycle of the circular ladder (prism) C_n X P_2. C_n denotes the cycle graph on n nodes and P_n denotes the path graph on n nodes.",

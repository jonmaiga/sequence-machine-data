  "description": "Square array read by antidiagonals: T(m,n) is the Wiener index of the flower graph F(m,n) (m>=2, n>=1). F(m,n) is the graph obtained by joining with an edge a node in the star graph on m nodes to an end-node of the path graph P_n. The Wiener index of a connected graph is the sum of distances between all unordered pairs of vertices in the graph.",

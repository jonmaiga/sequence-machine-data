  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of planar tanglegrams of size n with 0 <= k < n leaf-matched pairs. A leaf matched pair is a pair of non-leaf vertices (u,v) in the tanglegram such that the induced subtrees rooted and u and v also form a tanglegram (equivalently, the leaves in these two subtrees are matched by the matching that forms the original tanglegram).",

  "description": "The number of plane rooted complete ternary trees with 2n+1 unlabeled leaves (hence n internal nodes including the root where n starts at 0) satisfying these two conditions: (1) if one of the three children of any internal node is the greatest in deglex order then that child is not the leftmost child; (2) if one of the three children of any internal node is the smallest in deglex order then that child is not the rightmost child. Deglex order refers to degree-lexicographical order defined inductively on the number of leaves (see details under Comments).",

  "description": "The Wiener index of the tree g[n] (n>=0) defined recursively in the following manner: denoting by P[n] the path on n vertices, we define g[0] =P[2] while g[n] (n>=1) is the tree obtained by identifying the roots of 2 copies of g[n-1] and one of the end-vertices of P[n+1]; the root of g[n] is defined to be the other end-vertex of P[n+1].",

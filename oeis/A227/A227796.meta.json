  "description": "T(n,k,r,s) is the number of partitions in the s-th run of strictly increasing numbers of 2 X 2 X 2 cubes in the list of partitions of an n X k X r rectangular cuboid into integer-sided cubes, considering only the list of parts; irregular triangle T(n,k,r,s), n >= k >= r >= 1, s >= 1. The sorting order for the list of partitions is ascending with larger squares taking higher precedence.",

  "description": "Irregular triangular array: every periodic simple continued fraction CF represents a quadratic irrational (c + f*sqrt(d))/b, where b,c,f,d are integers and d is squarefree. Row n of this array shows the distinct values of d as CF ranges through the periodic continued fractions having period an n-tuple of 1s and 3s.",

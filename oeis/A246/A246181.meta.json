  "description": "Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of weighted lattice paths B(n) having k (1,0)-steps of weight 1. B(n) is the set of lattice paths of weight n that start in (0,0), end on the horizontal axis and never go below this axis, whose steps are of the following four kinds: a (1,0)-step of weight 1; a (1,0)-step of weight 2; a (1,1)-step of weight 2; a (1,-1)-step of weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.",

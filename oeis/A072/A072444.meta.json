  "description": "Number of subsets S of the power set P{1,2,...,n} such that: {1}, {2},..., {n} are all elements of S; if X and Y are elements of S and X and Y have a nonempty intersection, then the union of X and Y is an element of S. The sets S are counted modulo permutations on the elements 1,2,...,n.",

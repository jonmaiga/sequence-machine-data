  "description": "Let d(k) be the sequence whose values are in (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) and are such that the continued fraction for the decimal number D(n)=0.d(1)d(2)...d(n) has strictly more elements than the continued fraction for D(n-1)=0.d(1)d(2)...d(n-1) and d(n) is as small as possible. Sequence gives values of d(n)=a(n) for d(1)=1.",

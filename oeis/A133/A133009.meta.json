  "description": "One defining property of the sequences {A, B} = {A000069, A001969} is that they are the unique pair of sets complementary with respect to the nonnegative integers such that q(n) = |{x : x, y in A, x < y, x + y = n}| = |{x : x, y in B, x < y, x + y = n}| for all n >= 0. The present sequence gives the values of q(n).",

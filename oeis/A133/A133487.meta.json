  "description": "The first term is 256; each subsequent term in the series is computed by translating the previous term to binary, then reinterpreting the binary expansion as a product of metaprimes. Metaprimes follow the form p^(2^n) where p is a prime number and n is a nonnegative integer. See the link for more detailed explanation.",

  "description": "The defining property of the sequences {A, B} = {A000028, A000379} is that they are the unique pair of sets complementary with respect to the positive integers such that p(n) = |{x : x, y in A, x < y, xy = n}| = |{x : x, y in B, x < y, xy = n}| for all n >= 1. The present sequence gives the values of p(n).",

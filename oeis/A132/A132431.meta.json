  "description": "For n>0, let B_n be the subsemigroup of the full transformation monoid on the n-set [n] generated by the following functions: Let x be a certain element in [n]. Now the generators of B are those functions which map either x to any distinct element y in [n] leaving all the other elements fixed, or y to x leaving all the other elements fixed. Then a(n) = number of elements in B_n.",

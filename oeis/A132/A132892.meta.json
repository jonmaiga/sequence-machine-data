  "description": "Square array T(m,n) read by antidiagonals; T(m,n) is the number of equivalence classes in the set of sequences of n nonnegative integers that sum to m, generated by the equivalence relation defined in the following manner: we write a sequence in the form a[1]0a[2]0...0a[p], where each a[i] is a (possibly empty) sequence of positive integers; two sequences in this form, a[1]0a[2]0...0a[p] and b[1]0b[2]0...0b[q] are said to be equivalent if p=q and b[1],b[2],...,b[q] is a cyclic permutation of a[1],a[2],...a[p].",

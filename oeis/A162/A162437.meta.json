  "description": "a(1)=1, a(2)=2. Take terms a(n-1) and a(n-2), then convert to binary. Concatenate them, with either binary a(n-1) on the left and a(n-2) on the right, or with a(n-1) on the right and a(n-2) on the left such that the value of the resulting binary number is minimized. a(n) = the decimal equivalent of the resulting binary number.",

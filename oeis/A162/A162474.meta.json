  "description": "Let b(n,p(k)) be the exponent raising the k-th prime in the prime-factorization of n. (b(n,p(k)) may equal 0.) Write each b down in order and in binary (and exponent of zero is written as '0') with b(n,2) on the right and b(n,P) on the left, where P is the largest prime dividing n. Concatenate to form one binary number. a(n) is the decimal equivalent.",

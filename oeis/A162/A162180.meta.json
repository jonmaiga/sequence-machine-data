  "description": "Let a(n) = d[m(n),i] be the i-th divisor of the integer m(n) and the index j such that d[m(n),i] = d[m(n+1),j], m(n+1) is the first integer > m(n). The sequence a(n), starting with m(1) = 1, i = 1 is given by the conditions: a(1) = 1 and a(n+1) is the first predecessor of a(n) if n even, or the first successor of a(n) if n odd.",

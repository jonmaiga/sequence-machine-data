  "description": "The number of cycles in the Vers de Verres game, where 'worms' are transferred between 'cups' in a deterministic fashion. Because this defines a finite-state automaton, we know that every state eventually enters a cycle (or fixed point, which is essentially a cycle of length 1). The number of 'cups' (frequently called 'n') is a parameter for this automaton, and so we count the cycles (and fixed points) with respect to n.",

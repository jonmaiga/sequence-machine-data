  "description": "4^n = x*3^n+y*2^n+z*1^n, so 4^n equals the sum of a(n)=x+y+z pieces of like powers (=length of right side of solution of this Diophantine equation). Length of solutions obtained with \"greedy algorithm\" are given in A064630[n]. Here the binary order [A029837] of the length of those solutions is displayed, which \"on the average\" nearly equals n.",

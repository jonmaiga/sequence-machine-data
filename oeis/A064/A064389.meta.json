  "description": "Variation (4) on Recamán's sequence (A005132): to get a(n), we first try to subtract n from a(n-1): a(n) = a(n-1) - n if positive and not already in the sequence; if not then we try to add n: a(n) = a(n-1) + n if not already in the sequence; if this fails we try to subtract n+1 from a(n-1), or to add n+1 to a(n-1), or to subtract n+2, or to add n+2, etc., until one of these produces a positive number not already in the sequence - this is a(n).",

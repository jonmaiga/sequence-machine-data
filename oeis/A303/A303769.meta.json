  "description": "a(0) = 0, a(n+1) is either the largest number obtained from a(n) by toggling a single 1-bit off (to 0) if no such number is yet in the sequence, otherwise the least number not yet in sequence that can be obtained from a(n) by toggling a single 0-bit on (to 1). In both cases the bit to be toggled is the rightmost possible that results yet an unencountered number.",

# Sequence Machine Data

This is the [Sequence Machine](https://sequencedb.net/) data repository with terms (LFS), meta and programs.

All *.programs.txt have been found by testing different combinations of operations and are therefore conjectural.

The *.meta.json and *.terms.txt files is data extracted from the N.J.A. Sloane's [Online Encyclopedia of Integer SequencesÂ®](http://oeis.org/).

On top of that many of the *.terms.txt files have been extended by Sean A. Irvine and Georg Fischer's, [jOEIS](https://github.com/archmageirvine/joeis).
